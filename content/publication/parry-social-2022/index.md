abstract: 'Due to the methodological challenges inherent in studying social media
  use (SMU), as well as the methodological choices that have shaped research into
  the effects of SMU on well-being, clear conclusions regarding relationships between
  SMU and well-being remain elusive. We provide a review of five methodological developments
  poised to provide increased understanding in this domain: (a) increased use of longitudinal
  and experimental designs; (b) the adoption of behavioural (rather than self-report)
  measures of SMU; (c) focusing on more nuanced aspects of SMU; (d) embracing effect
  heterogeneity; and (e) the use of formal modelling and machine learning. We focus
  on how these advances stand to bring us closer to understanding relations between
  SMU and well-being, as well as the challenges associated with these developments.'
