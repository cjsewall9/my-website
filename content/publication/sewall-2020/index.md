abstract: This study examines how relationship quality in family and peer domains
  are associated with suicidal ideation (SI) in youth with bipolar disorder (BP).
  We assessed 404 Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth study participants for psychiatric
  disorders and SI at intake and for family/peer relationships the month after intake.
  Multivariate logistic regression examined associations between relationships and
  SI, controlling for significant covariates. There were 144 youth (36%) who reported
  SI at intake; bivariate analyses indicated they had significantly worse family/peer
  relationships. Multivariate analyses showed that family/peer relationships were
  associated with current SI, controlling for significant covariates. Results support
  associations between poor relationships and SI in BP youth, regardless of current
  mood symptom severity. Clinicians should assess relationships when completing risk
  assessments with BP youth.
