abstract: "Background: Suicide is now the 2nd leading cause of death among adolescents\
  \ and young adults. Social media's influence on youth suicidal risk or attenuation\
  \ of risk is a novel and rapidly expanding topic of research that requires attention\
  \ from a broad range of mental health services professionals. We aimed to provide\
  \ an updated review of social media-related risk and protective factors to youth\
  \ deliberate-self harm (DSH) to guide mental health services professionals in offering\
  \ care and support to youth vulnerable to suicide. Methods: Studies on which primary\
  \ research was conducted that evaluated young people's use of social media platforms\
  \ related to DSH were systematically searched via Scopus and identified through\
  \ expert recommendation and the Association for Computing Machinery's digital library\
  \ of conference materials. The search focused on the timeframe June 2014 to September\
  \ 2019, to offer an update since the time the most recent systematic reviews on\
  \ this topic concluded their literatures searches. Quality was reviewed using the\
  \ Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Results: A total of 38 articles were eligible,\
  \ and 24 articles rated as high quality were included in a narrative review. Of\
  \ the included articles, 19 explored DSH risk and 8 explored DSH protection. Most\
  \ articles reported on cross-sectional quantitative or qualitative studies. Opportunities\
  \ for both risks and benefits were explored, and potential influences of social\
  \ media use were considered for subgroups of youth who may be especially vulnerable\
  \ to suicide. Conclusions: In the relatively short period of review, the association\
  \ between social media use and youth DSH was tested in population-based studies,\
  \ offering preliminary evidence for suicide prevention and treatment efforts. Further\
  \ research is needed to understand the contribution of social media use to youth\
  \ DSH, particularly among youth most vulnerable to suicidal risk."
