abstract: There is growing recognition that many people feel the need to regulate
  their use of the internet and other digital technologies to support their wellbeing.
  In this study, we used Mozilla Firefox browser telemetry to investigate the role
  played by various usage factors in desires to regulate time spent online. In particular,
  we investigated how six metrics pertaining to time spent on the internet, and the
  diversity and intensity of use, predict participantsâ€™ (n = 8,094) desires to spend
  more or less time online. Across all six metrics, we did not find evidence for a
  relationship between browser usage metrics and participants wanting to spend more
  or less time online. This finding was robust across various analytical pathways.
  The study highlights a number of considerations and concerns that need to be addressed
  in future industry-academia collaborations that draw on trace data or usage telemetry.
