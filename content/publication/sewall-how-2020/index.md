abstract: Using Appleâ€™s Screen Time application to obtain reported actual iPhone and
  social media (SM) use, we examined the accuracy of retrospective estimates of usage,
  how inaccuracies bias associations between use and psychosocial well-being (depression,
  loneliness, and life satisfaction), and the degree to which inaccuracies were predicted
  by levels of well-being. Among a sample of 325 iPhone users, we found that (a) participants
  misestimated their weekly overall iPhone and SM use by 19.1 and 12.2 hours, respectively;
  (b) correlations between estimated use and well-being variables were consistently
  stronger than the correlations between reported actual use and well-being variables;
  and (c) the degree of inaccuracy in estimated use was associated with levels of
  participant well-being and amount of use. These findings suggest that retrospective
  estimates of digital technology use may be systematically biased by factors that
  are fundamental to the associations under investigation. We propose that retrospective
  estimates of digital technology use may be capturing the construct of perceived
  use rather than actual use, and discuss how the antecedents, correlates, and consequences
  of perceived use may be distinct from those of actual use. Implications of these
  findings are discussed in view of the ongoing debate surrounding the effects of
  digital technology use on well-being.
