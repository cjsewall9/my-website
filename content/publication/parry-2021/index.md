abstract: The influence of digital media on personal and social well-being is a question
  of immense public and academic interest. Scholars in this domain often use retrospective
  self-report measures of the quantity or duration of media use as a proxy for more
  objective measures, but the validity of these self-report measures remains unclear.
  Recent advancements in log-based data collection techniques have produced a growing
  collection of studies indexing both self-reported media use and device-logged measurements.
  Herein, we report a meta-analysis of this body of research. Based on 106effect sizes,
  we found that self-reported media usewas only moderately correlated with device-logged
  measurements, and that these self-report measures were rarely an accurate reflection
  of logged media use. These results demonstrate thatself-reported measures of the
  quantity or duration of media use are not a valid index of the amount of time people
  actually spend using media. These findings have serious implications for the study
  of media use and well-being, suggesting that cautiousness is warranted in drawing
  conclusions regarding media effects from studies relying solely on self-reported
  measures of media use.
