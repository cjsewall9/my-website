abstract: Purpose Research on juvenile reoffending has experienced an ecological turn,
  marked by an impressive expansion of studies that test the relation between elements
  of residential context and reoffending. Yet, to date, little consensus exists regarding
  what ecological factors matter, how they affect reoffending, and for whom they matter
  most. To address this gap, this study takes stock of research that tests the relationship
  between ecological factors and reoffending among youth. Methods A systematic review,
  in accordance with PRISMA-P guidelines, of quantitative studies (k = 27) was conducted.
  Evidence was synthesized quantitatively (i.e., meta-analytically, tabularly) and
  qualitatively (i.e., narratively). Results A variety of ecological factors have
  been tested, but results are inconsistent and reflect relatively few contexts and
  samples. The most frequently tested factor, concentrated disadvantage (k = 15),
  is a predictor of re-arrest (pooled OR = 1.09, p = .01). Inconsistent findings regarding
  other factors seem to reflect sample and study characteristics. Conclusions Research
  to date does not indicate summarily rejecting or accepting ecological factors as
  risk factors for reoffending. To further clarify the ecology-reoffending relationship
  and inform recidivism reduction interventions, future research should sample from
  unexamined contexts and test theoretically meaningful relationships via approaches
  that strengthen causal inference.
