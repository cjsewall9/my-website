abstract: While there is a substantive body of research on benefits conveyed via
  the human animal bond (HAB), less is understood about disruptions to HAB and how
  to potentially prevent such. The construct of commitment can elucidate such scenarios
  and may also help inform related interventions; however, there are few empirical
  measures of commitment to a companion animal, and none specific to low-income owners.
  The Commitment to Pets measure was created to address this gap. The scale was included
  in a mixed methods study of food security administered to 392 low-income adults
  utilizing food pantries in a Northeastern city in the United States. Of this number,
  258 (66%) owned pets. Data collection included a self-administered questionnaire
  about demographics, food security, health, and wellbeing, and for those with pets,
  animal attachment, commitment, and animal information. Qualitative interviews were
  conducted with 15 pet-owning individuals who completed the questionnaire and agreed
  to be contacted and interviewed over the phone about food security and their pets.
  Exploratory factor analyses found three underlying factors - financial costs/burdens;
  pet behaviors and problems; family problems. These subscales associated with attachment
  in that higher attachment was correlated with greater commitment. However, the value
  of the correlations suggests they are different constructs. Moreover, analysis of
  the qualitative interviews supported these underlying constructs and suggested that
  unexpected financial costs of veterinary care and food was a major factor in considering
  ongoing pet ownership, even when there was a deep level of attachment between humans
  and their animals. Commitment is a complex construct, and additional measurement
  studies are needed. Findings suggest community outreach models using cross?systems
  collaboration have potential to support low-income pet-owning families in their
  commitment to pets and may aid in prevention of surrenders and HAB disruptions.'
