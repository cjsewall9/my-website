abstract: Despite a plethora of research, the link between digital-technology use
  and psychological distress among young adults remains inconclusive. Findings in
  this area are typically undermined by methodological limitations related to measurement,
  study design, and statistical analysis. Addressing these limitations, we examined
  the prospective, withinpersons associations between three aspects of objectively
  measured digital-technology use (duration and frequency of smartphone use, duration
  of social-media use) and three aspects of psychological distress (depression, anxiety,
  and social isolation) among a sample of young adults (N = 384). Across 81 different
  model specifications, we found that most within-persons prospective effects between
  digital-technology use and psychological distress were statistically nonsignificant,
  and all were very small—even the largest effects were unlikely to register a meaningful
  impact on a person’s psychological distress. In post hoc subgroup analyses, we found
  scant evidence for the claim that digitaltechnology use is more harmful for women
  and/or younger people.
