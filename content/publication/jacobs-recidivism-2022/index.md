abstract: This study meta-analytically examined the effect of macro-level concentrated
  disadvantage on individual-level recidivism. Search results indicated research to
  date is designed to assess the incremental effect of concentrated disadvantage on
  recidivism above other risk factors. Using a multilevel random effects model, we
  found the estimated incremental effect of concentrated disadvantage was nonsignificant
  (log odds ratio = 0.03, p = .15, k = 48). However, effects varied by recidivism
  and offense type. Concentrated disadvantage does not add incremental utility when
  predicting general recidivism, but it does add incremental utility when assessing
  arrests (especially drug arrests) and violent reconvictions. Although individual-level
  risk factors and markers seem to explain most of the relationship between concentrated
  disadvantage and reoffending, concentrated disadvantage should not be summarily
  dismissed as irrelevant to recidivism. The overrepresentation of disadvantaged neighborhoods
  among the justice-involved—and the overrepresentation of the justice-involved in
  disadvantaged neighborhoods—requires further research on the disadvantage–recidivism
  relationship.
