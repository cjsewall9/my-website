Dr. Sewall is a Clinical Data Scientist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. His research has two interrelated foci: (1) understanding the relationship between digital media use and well-being among youth, and (2) leveraging advancements in ubiquitous computing and computational modeling to develop suicide prevention tools. Dr. Sewall’s current NIMH-funded work applies machine learning to passive sensing data collected from smartphones and wearables to predict suicidality among high-risk youth. Dr. Sewall’s research has been published in top-tier academic journals such as _Nature Human Behavior_, _Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry_, _Journal of Affective Disorders_, and _Clinical Psychological Science_, and featured in popular media outlets such as _Fast Company_, _Psychology Today_, and _Medical News Today_.
