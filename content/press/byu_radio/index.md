title: 'Technology and Mental Health'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'There’s a popular belief – shared by a lot of social scientists – that more time spent on social media and smart phones correlates to worse mental health – especially in young people. But University of Pittsburgh social worker and postdoctoral researcher Craig Sewall says most of those studies contain a fatal flaw that undermines the whole premise of social media causing depression and anxiety.'
